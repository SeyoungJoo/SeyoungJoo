## Hi I'm Seyoung ðŸ˜Ž
### curious & enthusiastic
After working as a photographer for five years, I changed my career as a developer after falling in love with front-end development. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Photography and spent two years in Korea and three years in Canada and Australia taking pictures, making money and learning English.
I started self-studying coding with half curiosity and half fear, and soon I fell in love with the coding world from the facts that I can constantly learn, and have no limitations. Coding was magic world for me.
My goal in 5 years is to become a thoughtful front-end developer who considers user experience well.
I like working alone & working with people both, and I like the feeling that I am continuously growing.
